#this is an an example of function plotting
#intro: relation between the required increase of sales quantity (y) and the given discount (x) to achieve the profit level without discount
#sign: Q-sales quantity, P-unit price, C-unit cost, y-increase rate of quantity, x-given discount
#modeling: Profit = Q.P - Q.C = Q(1+y).P(1-x) - Q(1+y).C
#giving constant: let unit price P = 150, unit cost C = 120
#resulting function: y(x)=5x/(1-5x)

#write the function
f <- function(x) 5*x/(1-5*x)

#produce the plot
